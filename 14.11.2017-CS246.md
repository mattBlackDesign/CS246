## Casting

Last time:

```C++
static_cast
reinterpret_cast
const_cast
```

The fourth type C++ class is `dynamic_cast`

```C++
Vector<Book*> books;
Books *op = books[i];
```

**Incorrect**
```C++
Text *tp = static_cast<Text*> (bp);
tp->getTopic();
```

Behaviour is undefined if `bp` is not printing to a `Text` object

We can use a `dynamic_cast` to tentatively try the type conversion and see if it succeeds. 

If it succeeds then `tp` is a valid ptr to the `Text` object

If it fails, then `tp` is set to `nullptr`

```C++
if (tp) cout << tp-getTopic(); 
else cout << "Not a Text"; 
```

to use dynamic_cast the class heracrhy must have at least one virtual method. 
- That's okay as we make destructors virtual 

RTT (Runtime Type Information)

```C++
void whatIsIt(Book *bp) {
  if (dynamic_cast<Text*> (bp)) {
    cout << "A Text";
  } else if (dyanmic_cast<Comic*> (bp)) {
    cout << "A Comic";
  } ele {
  cout << "A Book";
  }
}
```

- This code is highly coupled to the class hierachy

- Better approach is to use virtual methods

Dynamic Cast works on references

```C++
Book &rb = ...;
Text &tr = dynamic_cast<Text&> (rb);
```

- If `rb` is actually a reference to a `Text`, then `tr` is a valid reference to this object. 

- What if it's not 
    - Cannot assign a reference to be nullptr
    - `bad_cast` exception is thrown

## Big 5 Revisited (inheritance)

```C++
class Book {
  ...
};
class Text: public Book {
  ...
};
Text a {...};
Text b = a;

```
// The free copy constructor for Text is called
- first calls the free copy constructor for Book
- construct the subclass field (topic)

```C++
// Copy Constructor
Text::Text(const Text &other): Book{other}, topic{other.topic} {}
// Copy Assignment Operator
Text &Text::operator=(const Text &other) {
  Book::operator=(other);
  topic = other.topic;
  return *this;
}
```

**Incorrect Move Constructor**
```C++
Text::Text(Text &&other): Book{other}, topic{other.topic} {}
```

other is an rvalue reference

What is an rvalue reference? 

either a temporary object, or one that is about to be destroyed

other is pointing to something that is about to be destroyed

other is also a parameter

other is a variable therefore making it an lvalue

other is not about to be destroyed

other is pointing to something that is about to be destroyed

We need a way to say that treat other as if it were an rvalue

The std library provides `std::move`, a function that allows us to tree an lvalue as an rvalue. 

**Correct Move Constructor**

```C++
Text::Text(Text &&other): Book(std::move(other)), topic{std::move(other.topic)} {}
```

**Move Assignment Operator**
```C++
Text &Text::opreator=(Text &&other) {
  Book::operator=(std::move(other));
  topic = std::move(other.topic);
  return *this;
}
```

## Assignment Operator in Detail

```C++
Text b1{"B1", "Nomair", 200, "CS"};
Text b2{"B2", "Brad", 100, "Physics"};
Book *pb1 = &b1;
Book *pb2 = &b2;
*pb1 = *pb2; // object assignment
```

The compiler looks at the declared type of the `pb1` and decides to call `Book::operator=` (static dispatch).

- Only the Book part is assigned 
`b1` becomes `"B2", "Brad", 100, "CS"`

### Partial Assignment Problem

#### Two way to fix this

#### Approach 1. 

Let's prevent assignment through base class pointers. 

- Make `Book::operator=` private??
    - but then subclasses won't have access either
    - you have stopped assignment of any book ever
- Make `Book::operator=` protected??
    - but this prevents actual Books from ever being assigned
- Advice: Base classes should be abstract

```
                 +---------------+
                 |               |
                 |  AbstractBook |
                 |               |
                 +-------+-------+
                         ^
       +-----------------------------+
       |                 |           |
+------+------+   +------+---+  +----+---+
| NormalBook  |   |   Text   |  | Comic  |
+-------------+   +----------+  +--------+
|             |   |          |  |        |
|             |   |          |  |        |
+-------------+   +----------+  +--------+

```

```C++
class AbstractBook {
  string title, authors;
  int numPages;
 protected:
  AbstractBook &operator=(const AbstractBook &other) {...}
 public:
  virtual ~AbstractBook() = 0; // make class abstract // still must implement destructor
};
```

```C++
Text a {...}
Text b {...}
AbstractBook *pa = &a;
AbstractBook *pb = &b;
*pa = *pb; // will not compile as AbstractBook::operator= is protected
```

**Succeeded Approach 1**

Make assignment operator protected

Disallowed partial assignment

Doesn't really solve the problem, just disallows this method

#### Approach 2. 

Let's make `operator=` virtual

```C++
class Book {
  ...
 public:
  virtual Book &operator=(const Book &other) {...}
};
class Text: public Book {
  ...
 public:
  Text &operator=(const Book &other) override {
    ...
  }
}
```

**^ Wrong**

To be a valid override the parameters of `Text::operator=` must be a Book

Change `Text &operator=(const Text &other) override ` to `Text &operator=(const Book &other) override `

But this allows the rhs to be any type of Book not just Text ... not a solution

#### This is called the Mixed assignment problem

- Let's allow assignment only when the rhs is a Text

```C++
Text &Text::operator(const Book &other) override {
  Text &tother = dynamic_cast<Text &> (other);
  Book::operator=(tother);
  topic = tother.topic;
  return *this;
}
```

```C++
Text a{...}
Text b{...}
Comic c{...}
Book *pa = &a;
Book *pb = &b;
Book *pc = &c;
// Now Try
a = c; // This compiles, but when it runs, it will run dynamic_cast, and a bad_cast exception will be thrown
*pa = *pc; // bad_cast again
// prevented partial assignment and mixed assignment
a = b; // Works 
*pa = *pb; // Works
```

### Design Quality, MVC, Exception Safety

Coupling

How much do modules depend on each other

low coupling, modules communicate using function calls with basic parameter types

High: 
- passing structs
- acessing global variables

High coupling: modules access implementation details 
- friends
- public fields

Goal: low coupling

Cohesion
- how relevant are the elements of a module

low cohesion: arbitrary grouping of unrelated elements

`<utility> _std::move, std::pair, std::swap`

high cohesion: a module achieves exactly one task

Goal: high cohesion

***

#### Decouple the interface (MVC)

Advice: primary program classes should not print things

```C++
class ChessBoard { // game state
  ...
  cout << "Your move";
  ...
}
```

ChessBoard is coupled to cout 

What if we want to output to files/over internet

Better: use stream objects to read/write. 

```C++
class ChessBoard {
  ...
  istream &in;
  istream &out;
  ...
  in >> nextmove;
  out << "your Move";
};
```

We are still coupled to stream objects!

What if we want a graphical interface?

**ChessBoard** should not be communicating at all!

#### Single Responsibility Principal: a class shoudl only have on reason to change

Game state + communication over 2 reasons

ChessBoard should communicate using parameters/return values of function calls

- Use a seperate communication module

#### MVC: Model-View-Controller Design Pattern

```
+-------+             +------+
| Model |             | View |
+-------+             +------+
        +------------+
        | Controller |
        +------------+
```

Model: maintains data (game state)
View: interface to the user
Controller: facilitates communication between the model and the view

Model <-> View(s) can be in a Subject-Observer relationship

```
Model -> Controller -> View
+-------------------------+
Subject_Observer
+--------------+
            Subject_Observer
            +--------------+
```


#### Motivation

void f() {
  MyClass *p = new MyClass;
  MyClass mc;
  g();
  delete p;
}

if `g()` throws, there is a memory leak!!

#### Exception Safety

If an exception occurs the program should not leak memory, have dangling pointers, 
break class invariants, etc. 

C++ Guarantee: during stack-unwinding all stack-allocated data is destroyed 
(destructors run, memory reclaimed) 

- `mc` is reclaimed, however `p` leaked memory

We should write code that prevents this memory leak

```C++
void f() {
  MyClass *p = new MyClass;
  try {
    MyClass mc;
    g();
  } catch (...) { // catch everything
    delete p;
    throw;
  }
}
```

Tedious/error prone

It woudl be nice to have a guarantee that some piece of code always runs

```Java
finally // Java
```

```Scheme
dynamic_wind // Scheme
```

C++ has no such feature 
- It does not need it

Advice: maximize the use of stack

What to do when we do need to heap allocate? 

RAII: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization

Wrap every resource in a stack-allocated object whose job is to release that resource.

```C++
{
ifstream f{ "file.txt" }
}
```

- The file resource is acquired by the constructor file is released by the destructor 
- This happens even if an exception is thrown

***

Heap memory is a resource
- put heap allocated memory inside a stack allocated object whose job is to free the memory

#### Smart Pointers

`std::unique_ptr<T>`

- Constructor takes a `T*`
- Destructor will delete this pointer

You can use a `unique_ptr` object as if it was a pointer into the heap

`operator*`, `operator->` are overloaded

```C++
void f() {
  std::unique_ptr<MyClass> p {new MyClass};
  auto p = std::make_unique<MyClass>(parameters); // includes parameters for constructor
  MyClass mc;
  g();
}
```

Heap memory is deallocated irrespective of whether an example occurs or not,

#### Problem

```C++
unique_ptr<MyClass> p{new MyClass};
unique_ptr<MyClass> q = ; // will not compile
// call to unique_ptr copy constructor
```

Copy Constructor/Copy Assignment Operator are disabled

`unique_ptr/basicimpl.cc`

You cannot copy `unique_ptr`'s, however you can move them

`std::shared_ptr` will allow multiple pointers to some heap object

```C++
void f() {
  auto p1 = make_shared<MyClass>();
  ...
  if (...) {
    auto p2 = p1;
    ...
  } // destructor for p2 runs 
} // destructor for p1 runs
```

`shared_ptr` uses reference counting to track how many objects have a pointerto the heap object

The destructor only deletes the heap object when the reference count becomes `0`.

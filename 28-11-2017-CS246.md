### Exception Safety, Template functions

#### Last time

- RAII: Resource Acquisition Is Initiliazation

Use `shared_ptr`/`unique_ptr` to manage heap memory 

You can cast `shared_ptr` objects
- `static_pointer_cast`
- `const-pointer_cast`
- `dynamic_pointer_cast`


### Exception Safety

3 levels of exception safety

**Basic guarantee**: if an exception occurs the program is in a valid but unspecified state
- no memory leaks, no dangling ptr, no broken class invariants 


**Strong Guarantee**: if an exception occurs during the execution of a 
function `f`, it is as if `f` was never called

No-throw guarantee: function never throws an exception. Always achieves it's goal. 

Example:
```C++
Class A {...};
Class B {...};
Class C {
  A a;
  B b;
  public:
  void f() {
    a.m1(); // strong guarantee
    a.m2(); // strong guarantee
  }
};
```

`f()` is not no-throw

Does `f()` have a strong guarantee?
- if `m1()` throws, it's as if `m1` was never called => `f()` was never called. 
- if `m2()` throws, then while its as if `m2()` was never called, 
m1 might have made changes to the program state
=> `f()` does not provide a strong guarantee

To provide a strong guarantee, changes made to `m1()` must be undone 

- often undoing things is not possible e.g. printing (i.e. no_local side effects)

Assume `m1`/`m2` only have local side-effects

Can we re-write `f()` to provide a strong guarantee? 

Idea: instead of trying to undo things, let's "do" the things on copies. 
If we succeed, swap the copies with the originals. 

```C++
C::f() {
  A atemp {a};  // Copy
  B btemp {b};  // Copy
  atemp.m1();
  atemp.m2();
  a = atemp; // swap / assignment
  b = btemp; //
}
```
But what if assignment of B throws an exception? 
=> a is changed; b is not

Since ptr assignment never throws, let's create ptrs to copies of objects of swap ptr. 

-> Will use pImple idiom

***

```C++
struct CImpl { A a; B b; };

Class C {
  unique_ptr<CImpl> pImpl;
public:
  void f() {
    unique_ptr<CImpl> temp {new CImpl{*pImpl}};
    //                                Cimpl Obj
    //                     //  Copy ctor for CImpl

    // auto temp = make_unique<CImpl>(*pImpl);
    temp->a.ml();
    temp->b.m2();
    swap(pImpl, temp); // no throw
  }
};
```

`std::swap` on smart ptrs will swap the heap ptrs within these objects

***

Exception safety in the STL

`<vector>`
- wraps a heap allocated array
- uses RAII
- destructor deallocates the array

```C++
vector<MyClass> v;
// when v goes out of scope, elements of v are destroyed, then the heap array is destroyed

vector<MyClass*> v;
// When v1 goes out of scope, 
delete is NOT called on elements of v1, heap array is deleted
```

`vector<Observer*> observers;`

A programmer has to manually delete if the elements are indeed owned by the vector

```C++
for(auto &p : v1) delete p;
```

But we don't want to manage memory 

```C++
vector<shared_ptr<MyClass>> vz;
// when vz goes out of scope, elements are destroyed (destructors run for shared_ptr objects)
```

the destroy will decrease the reference count if refcount is 0, object is deallocatd

`vector<T>::emplace_back` gives a strong guarantee. 

- adding an element to a not yet full array (size < capacity)
- `size == capacity`
    - create a larger heap array
    - copy from old array to new array
    - deallocate old array (delete is no throw)

Instead of copying we culd move elements to the new array
=> more efficient 

- if during move an exception occured; your old array has been changed, your old array has been changed
- **no strong guarantee**

`emplace_back` will use move operations only if they guarantee that they are no throw

Otherwise, if the guarantee is not given, the slower but safer copy operations are used.

```C++
Class MyClass {
  MyClass(MyClass &&other) noexcept {
    ...

  }
}
```

Always writing noexcept (especially for the MOve constructor or Move operator=) guarantees that other code
can rely on this info.
